#yTop

Watching confrence talks or lectures or following along on a tutorial on youtube sucks.
You have to split the screen and then constantly fuss that its the right size and if you make the window too small, it gets smaller.


#Dependancies
Be sure electron is installed globally, you can do that with:
npm install -g Electron

#Installation
clone the repo then
npm install

change the ../main.js in the ytop.bat to the absolute path of the main.js in the root of the directory

then add yTop/bin to your path and you are all done

#Usage
pass a youtube VideoID as the first and only arguement
